This is this Python code: https://github.com/RaspberryPi400/Study-guide-creator 
But, it is for a GitHub Pages site which you can find here https://raspberrypi400.github.io/Make-Your-Own-Study-Guide/ So, it was changed to HTML/Javascript.

The way it works is you tell it the questions that you want it to ask you and the correct answers to those questions. Then, it will shuffle the pairs of the questions and answers. Now, you can answer them. If you get it wrong, it will tell you the correct answer. Keep in mind that when answering the questions that you created, it is case sensitive so write the answer either lowercase or uppercase, just like you told it earlier. Once you're done answering, you will get a score of how many questions that you got correct. Hope you get 100 on your test!
